How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
* Add Comments
* Take a logical approach
* Modularize functions and write for reusability
  
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
* Approach logically
* Solve one problem at a time
* Break down large problems into smaller steps
  
What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
* Computer scientists solve problems. Work on this type of projects enables others to be more productive and sometimes solve problems they otherwise could not have.
